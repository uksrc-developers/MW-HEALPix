# MW-HEALPix
---
This repository contains all the code relevant to running HEALPix as part of the Multiwave Demonstrator Case.


## Introduction


Need to include the purpose of the code in the repo
A description of the repo and and the code in it

## Hardware and Software




## Directory Structure




## Inputs and outputs




## Running MW-HEALPix




## Future Work


The code maybe adjusted so that it creates directories for each HEALPix area. This would mean that the six output catalogues would go into an individual directory, identified by HEALPix number, inside the original output directory. This change maybe added as a way to allow for easier batching in step further down the pipeline.
